### The model of the CPU on your laptop

* Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10850H CPU

### The clock speed of your laptop

* Base Speed - 2.71 GHz

### The kind of memory on your laptop

* DDR4

### The amount of RAM in your laptop

* 32 GB (31.6 GB Usable)

### The speed of the RAM in your laptop

* 2933 MHz

### The amount of cache for your laptop

## Part 3: Intel Intrinsics

### How much faster is CRC using intrinsic vs. regular C++?

* ~18 times faster using optimized code. ~34 times faster using non-optimized code

### Why is the CRC using the intrinsics more efficient than the crc code written in straight C++?

* Because the intrinsic command is written with assembler code specific to your processor type

### What is an Intel Intrinsic?

* A built in C++ function specific to the Intel CPU architecture.

### What is the disadvantage of embedding an intrinsic in your code?

* It will only work on newer processors that support said intrinsic.
